    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
    <p>Here at PoodleGroom, we not only groom poodles. 
        But all types of dogs and the occasional cat. 
        We believe <b>EVERY</b> pet should be treated like a pampered poodle.</p>
    
    <h2>Grooming</h2>
    <p>We offer a variety of different grooming options, ranging from the standard wash and trim to a complete makeover! 
        For more details and booking options, head over to our grooming page. 
        You don't see anything you like? Well, here at PoodleGroom, we offer custom grooming options. 
        All you need to do is fill out the form on our custom page.</p>

    <h2>Beginnings</h2>
    <p>Like all great businesses, PoodleGroom comes from humble beginnings. 
        Our first shop only had one tub, a trimming table, and two pet crates. 
        So we could only serve 2-3 smaller dogs a day. 
        But over time, through word of mouth, flyers, and social media, we were able to grow into what we are today.<br><br> 
        Thanks to all of you, we have become one of the most popular and affordable pet groomers in the U.S., 
        and to show our love and appreciation, all first grooms are <em>50% off unless custom</em>. </p>
